# Task: Locate and Fix Undetected Bug

## Current Task

The user wants me to find a bug in the codebase that is not detected by the test suite. I need to write a test that exposes the bug, and then fix the bug.

## Progress Summary

I have been working on this task for a while, but I have not yet been able to find a bug in the application code. Instead, I have found several bugs in the test suite itself. I have been working to fix these bugs so that I can get a clean test run and then analyze the test coverage to find a bug in the application code.

## Work Done So Far

*   I started by trying to run the test coverage script, but it failed due to a `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows. I fixed this by replacing the emojis in the script with ASCII characters.
*   The script then failed because `pytest` was not found. I fixed this by activating the virtual environment before running the script.
*   The script then failed because the `pytest-cov` plugin was not installed. I fixed this by adding `pytest-cov` to the `pyproject.toml` file and installing the project dependencies.
*   The tests then started running, but there were a large number of failures. I have been working to fix these failures one by one.
*   I fixed a bug in the `BaseMetaStrategy` that was causing many of the meta-strategy tests to fail.
*   I fixed a bug in the `test_strategy_has_scenario` test that was causing it to fail.
*   I fixed a bug in the `dummy_strategy_test.yaml` file that was causing the `test_strategy_param_prefixes` test to fail.
*   I attempted to fix the `test_range_violation` test, but I introduced an `IndentationError` in the process.

## What Worked

*   I was able to fix the `UnicodeEncodeError` in the test coverage script.
*   I was able to get the tests to run by activating the virtual environment and installing the necessary dependencies.
*   I was able to fix several of the failing tests.

## What Did Not Work

*   I have not yet been able to get a clean test run.
*   I have not yet been able to analyze the test coverage to find a bug in the application code.
*   I introduced an `IndentationError` while trying to fix one of the tests.

## Important Findings and Tricky Problems

*   The test suite is not as robust as it could be. There are several bugs in the tests themselves that are preventing me from getting a clean test run.
*   The meta-strategy implementation is complex and difficult to debug.
*   The YAML parsing and validation is also complex and has been a source of several errors.

## Current State

I am currently in the process of fixing the `IndentationError` in `tests/unit/core/test_yaml_error_handling.py`. Once I have fixed this error, I will rerun the tests and continue to address any remaining failures.

## What Remains to Be Done

1.  Fix the `IndentationError` in `tests/unit/core/test_yaml_error_handling.py`.
2.  Get a clean test run with no failing tests.
3.  Analyze the test coverage to find a bug in the application code.
4.  Write a test that exposes the bug.
5.  Fix the bug.
6.  Ensure that all tests pass after the bug fix.
7.  Summarize the bug and the fix for the user.
