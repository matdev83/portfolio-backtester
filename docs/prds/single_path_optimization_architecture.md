# PRD: Single Path Optimization Architecture

## Document Information
- **Document Type**: Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-08-04
- **Status**: Draft
- **Owner**: Portfolio Backtester Development Team

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the requirements for implementing a single-path optimization architecture for the portfolio backtester system. The current dual-path architecture with Numba optimizations and pandas fallbacks has proven to be error-prone, maintenance-heavy, and produces systematically different results. This initiative will eliminate all dual execution paths and establish a single, optimized, and provable code execution path for all backtesting and optimization operations.

## Problem Statement

### Current State Issues
1. **Critical Bug**: Dual implementations produce different results (4-5% differences in financial metrics)
2. **Architectural Complexity**: 20+ files maintain both optimized and fallback implementations
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Every algorithm change requires updating multiple code paths
4. **Result Inconsistency**: Backtest outcomes depend on which execution path is taken
5. **Testing Complexity**: Need to validate equivalence between multiple implementations

### Business Impact
- **Financial Risk**: Different execution paths produce different trading signals
- **Development Velocity**: Dual maintenance slows feature development
- **Quality Risk**: Implementation divergence creates hard-to-detect bugs
- **Operational Risk**: Inconsistent results undermine system reliability

## Product Vision

**Create a single, optimized, and provable execution path for all portfolio backtesting and optimization operations that delivers consistent results, improved performance, and simplified maintenance.**

## Product Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Single Execution Path**: Eliminate all dual/multiple execution paths
2. **Consistent Results**: Ensure provable, deterministic outcomes
3. **Performance Optimization**: Maximize performance through unified optimization approach
4. **Simplified Architecture**: Reduce codebase complexity and maintenance burden

### Secondary Goals
1. **Improved Developer Experience**: Simplify debugging and profiling
2. **Enhanced Reliability**: Eliminate implementation divergence bugs
3. **Better Performance Monitoring**: Enable focused optimization efforts
4. **Reduced Technical Debt**: Clean up architectural complexity
