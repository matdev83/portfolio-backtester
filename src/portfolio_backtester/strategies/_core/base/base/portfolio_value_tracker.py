# This module was a duplicate portfolio value tracker for meta strategies.
# It has been removed to avoid duplication and dual-path maintenance.
# Meta strategies should use the unified trade tracking and portfolio value
# tracking facilities under `portfolio_backtester.trading` or their own
# trade aggregator outputs directly.
