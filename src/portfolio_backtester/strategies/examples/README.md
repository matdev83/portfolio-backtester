# Example Strategies

This directory contains example strategies designed for learning and demonstration purposes. These strategies are:

- **Educational**: Designed to teach concepts and best practices
- **Well-documented**: Include extensive comments explaining the logic
- **Simple**: Focus on clarity over complexity
- **Stable**: Won't change frequently, safe to use as learning references

## Purpose

These examples serve as:
- Starting points for developing your own strategies
- Reference implementations of common patterns
- Teaching materials for understanding the framework

## Usage

You can copy and modify these strategies as starting points for your own implementations. They demonstrate:
- Proper inheritance from base strategy classes
- Parameter handling and validation
- Signal generation patterns
- Risk management integration

## Not for Production

These are simplified examples. For production use, consider:
- More sophisticated risk management
- Robust parameter validation
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing
