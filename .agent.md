# Workspace notes

- To execute Python in this project always use this executable: .venv/Scripts/python.exe
- Before executing any commands ensure you activated venv from the .venv directory (with dot at the beginning)
- Before submitting any tasks as finished, you need to make sure you always can prove the code is working by running tests
