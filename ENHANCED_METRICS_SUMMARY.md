## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from portfolio_backtester.trading.trade_tracker import TradeTracker
from portfolio_backtester.reporting.performance_metrics import calculate_metrics

# Initialize trade tracker
tracker = TradeTracker(portfolio_value=100000)

# Track positions during backtesting (supports both long and short)
tracker.update_positions(date, weights, prices, transaction_cost)
tracker.update_mfe_mae(date, prices)

# Get comprehensive directional statistics
trade_stats = tracker.get_trade_statistics()

# Get formatted table for easy comparison
table = tracker.get_trade_statistics_table()
print(table)

# Get summary by direction
summary = tracker.get_directional_summary()
print(summary)

# Calculate enhanced metrics with directional data
metrics = calculate_metrics(
    returns, 
    benchmark_returns, 
    'SPY',
    trade_stats=trade_stats
)
```

### Directional Statistics Structure
```python
# Example of directional statistics output
trade_stats = {
    # All trades
    'all_num_trades': 50,
    'all_win_rate_pct': 62.0,
    'all_largest_profit': 1500.0,
    'all_largest_loss': -800.0,
    'all_reward_risk_ratio': 1.85,
    
    # Long trades only
    'long_num_trades': 30,
    'long_win_rate_pct': 65.0,
    'long_largest_profit': 1500.0,
    'long_reward_risk_ratio': 2.1,
    
    # Short trades only
    'short_num_trades': 20,
    'short_win_rate_pct': 57.5,
    'short_largest_profit': 900.0,
    'short_reward_risk_ratio': 1.5,
    
    # Portfolio-level metrics
    'max_margin_load': 0.95,
    'mean_margin_load': 0.75
}
```

### Integration with Existing Backtester
The enhanced directional metrics are automatically calculated when running backtests:

```python
# Standard backtest - now includes directional metrics
backtester = StrategyBacktester(global_config, data_source)
result = backtester.backtest_strategy(strategy_config, monthly_data, daily_data, returns)

# Directional metrics are included in result.metrics
print(result.metrics['Number of Trades (All)'])
print(result.metrics['Number of Trades (Long)'])
print(result.metrics['Number of Trades (Short)'])
print(result.metrics['Win Rate % (All)'])
print(result.metrics['Win Rate % (Long)'])
print(result.metrics['Win Rate % (Short)'])
print(result.metrics['Reward/Risk Ratio (All)'])
print(result.metrics['Largest Single Profit (Long)'])
print(result.metrics['Largest Single Loss (Short)'])
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Mode
- Trade tracking is **disabled** during optimization for performance
- Only basic return-based metrics are calculated
- Maintains fast optimization speeds

### Full Backtest Mode  
- Trade tracking is **enabled** for comprehensive analysis
- All enhanced metrics are calculated
- Detailed trade history is generated

### Memory Usage
- Trade tracker stores individual trade records
- Memory usage scales with number of trades
- Efficient for typical backtesting scenarios (hundreds to thousands of trades)

## Backward Compatibility

### Existing Code
- All existing code continues to work unchanged
- `calculate_metrics()` function maintains original signature
- Portfolio logic returns are handled with both old and new formats

### Migration Path
- No changes required for existing strategies
- Enhanced metrics automatically available when using `StrategyBacktester`
- Optional trade tracking can be enabled/disabled as needed

## Testing and Validation
