description: To confirm everything is working pick one of the strategies and run optimizer on it. Monitor output. Look for warnings, stack traces, unexpected data like NaNs, -inf, +inf, zeroes where not expected. Also check for the realism of calculated strategy performance measures. If strategy's total performance is 0% or some unbelivabely high number counted in thousands of percent, be skeptical and look for logical and coding failures
