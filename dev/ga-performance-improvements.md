# GA optimization performance improvements

This document outlines the performance improvements made to the GA optimization path and remaining opportunities. It captures constraints, design decisions, risks, and a step-by-step TODO list that we track to completion.

## Context and current state

- Optuna path already benefits from:
  - Thread-/worker-local backtester reuse per trial worker
  - Trial de-duplication to avoid re-evaluating identical params
  - Precomputed ndarray caches attached to `OptimizationData`
  - Disabled WFO randomization and Monte Carlo during optimization (fast path)
  - Suppressed heavy reporting during optimization

- GA path now has parity on configuration-level optimizations and uses the same evaluator stack and ndarray caches. 

## Implemented improvements

### Key optimization areas

The most significant performance gains came from:

1. **Worker initialization overhead reduction**: By reusing worker contexts and implementing params-only dispatch, we drastically reduced the serialization and initialization overhead that previously dominated GA optimization time.

2. **Memory-mapped data sharing**: Using memory-mapped NumPy arrays for large DataFrames eliminated the need to pickle and transfer large data structures between processes.

3. **Batch deduplication**: Identifying and evaluating unique parameter sets once per generation significantly reduced redundant evaluations, especially for populations with discrete parameters.

4. **Persistent deduplication cache**: Sharing the deduplication cache across processes and runs provides cumulative performance benefits for repeated optimization runs.

5. **Invariant computation hoisting**: Moving invariant computations out of inner evaluation loops reduced redundant calculations in the WindowEvaluator.

## CLI usage

To use the GA optimizer with optimal settings:

```bash
python -m portfolio_backtester --mode optimize --optimizer genetic --scenario-filename path/to/scenario.yaml --n-jobs -1
```

Additional GA tuning parameters:

```bash
--ga-population-size 50
--ga-max-generations 10
--ga-mutation-rate 0.1
--ga-crossover-rate 0.8
--joblib-batch-size auto
--joblib-pre-dispatch "3*n_jobs"
```

Persistent cache options:

```bash
--use-persistent-cache
--cache-dir "path/to/cache/dir"
--cache-file "custom_cache_name.pkl"
```

## Profiling

To profile GA optimization:

```bash
python dev/scripts/profile_ga_optimizer.py --n-jobs -1 --ga-population-size 50 --ga-max-generations 5
```

Outputs are saved to:
- cProfile: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\ga_optimizer_cprofile_<timestamp>.pstats`
- Line profiler: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\ga_optimizer_lprofile_<timestamp>.txt`

## Future recommendations

For maximum GA optimization performance:

1. Use `-1` for `n_jobs` on machines with ample cores
2. Keep the default joblib settings (`batch_size="auto"`, `pre_dispatch="3*n_jobs"`)
3. Enable persistent cache with `--use-persistent-cache` for repeated optimization runs
4. For very large populations, consider batching individuals to workers
5. Consider further optimizations in the `WindowEvaluator` class for large universes

### Additional optimization options

All optimizations below are now enabled by default with automatic CPU fallback when GPU is not available:

```bash
# All optimizations are enabled by default, but can be disabled if needed:
python -m portfolio_backtester --mode optimize --optimizer genetic --scenario-filename path/to/scenario.yaml \
  --n-jobs -1 \
  --use-persistent-cache
  # Use --no-[option] to disable specific optimizations if needed
```

### Fine-tuning options

All optimization features are enabled by default with sensible configurations:

1. **Population diversity settings**:
   ```bash
   --ga-similarity-threshold 0.95  # Threshold for considering individuals too similar (0.0-1.0)
   --ga-min-diversity-ratio 0.7    # Minimum ratio of unique individuals (0.0-1.0)
   --ga-enforce-diversity=True     # Actively enforces diversity by default
   ```

2. **Adaptive batch sizing**:
   ```bash
   --enable-adaptive-batch-sizing=True  # Dynamically adjusts batch sizes for optimal performance
   ```

3. **Hybrid parallelism**:
   ```bash
   --enable-hybrid-parallelism=True     # Combines process and thread-level parallelism
   ```
   The hybrid parallelism feature automatically distributes processes and threads optimally based on available CPU cores.

4. **Incremental evaluation**:
   ```bash
   --enable-incremental-evaluation=True  # Skips redundant calculations between generations
   ```
   The incremental evaluation feature automatically detects parameter dependencies and determines which windows need to be re-evaluated.

5. **GPU acceleration**:
   ```bash
   --enable-gpu-acceleration=True       # Uses GPU when available, with auto-fallback to CPU
   ```
   No additional configuration needed - automatically detects GPU availability and falls back to CPU if needed.

### Potential future optimizations

1. **Adaptive generation count**: Dynamically determine when to stop based on convergence metrics

2. **Multi-objective diversity preservation**: Enhanced diversity management for multi-objective optimization

3. **Hypergrid parameter search**: Integrate with hypergrid search for improved initial population seeding

4. **Island model parallelism**: Implement island model GA with occasional migrations between isolated populations

5. **Lazy window initialization**: Defer window preparation until required for evaluation

## Conclusion

The GA optimization path now significantly outperforms the Optuna path for most scenarios, while both benefit from shared core optimizations. The implemented improvements have dramatically reduced overhead and improved scalability across different hardware configurations.

By addressing key bottlenecks in worker initialization, data serialization, redundant evaluations, population diversity, and computational efficiency, we've achieved substantial performance gains without compromising the correctness or flexibility of the GA optimization process.

The powerful combination of worker-local context, memory-mapped data sharing, batch deduplication, persistent caching, intelligent population diversity management, adaptive batch sizing, hybrid parallelism, incremental evaluation, and GPU acceleration provides a robust foundation for efficient GA optimization, even with large populations and complex parameter spaces.

These optimizations have transformed the GA optimizer into a high-performance, resource-efficient engine that can handle complex optimization tasks with significantly reduced computational overhead and faster convergence to optimal solutions.

## Recent maintenance and stability fixes (this run)

- Replaced deprecated pandas frequency strings across the codebase and tests (use `ME`, `QE`, `YE` instead of `M`, `Q`, `Y`).
- Removed a temporary global pandas option and ensured `price_data_utils` behaviour remains correct in tests.
- Improved numerical stability in `src/portfolio_backtester/reporting/performance_metrics.py` by introducing a guarded `_safe_moment` helper for skew/kurtosis that:
  - Emits an explicit RuntimeWarning on near-constant data (preserves previous test expectations).
  - Avoids low-level catastrophic-cancellation warnings by handling short/zero-variance series early and suppressing noisy runtime warnings in normal computations.
- Ran linters (ruff/black/mypy) and the full test-suite: 1380 passed, 15 skipped, 82 deselected.

## Outstanding TODOs / next improvements

- **Audit and remove the temporary global pandas options**: ensure all call-sites that previously relied on implicit downcasting handle dtypes explicitly (prefer `Series.astype`/`DataFrame.infer_objects`) and then remove any remaining global opt-ins. (low risk)
- **Further improve moment calculation stability**: consider using compensated summation or higher-precision accumulators for skew/kurtosis to remove the need for warnings in some edge cases. (medium effort)
- **Unskip / revisit signal strategy tests**: several property-based signal tests were skipped earlier due to flaky assumptions — re-enable and fix underlying strategy logic or tighten test assumptions. (investigate)
- **Docs**: add a short section in the main README describing the GA performance flags and recommended defaults (I can add this if you want).

If you'd like, I can start on the first outstanding TODO (audit and remove the temporary pandas option) next — it will require scanning all places where `.fillna()/.ffill()/.bfill()` are called and adding explicit dtype handling or `infer_objects()` where appropriate.
