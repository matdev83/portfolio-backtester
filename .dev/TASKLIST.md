- [ ] Improve data download process: 1. Import python library used to generate/check market holiday days. 2. Create a new meta-downloader. It should by default use Stooq data. After downloading all available data from Stooq it should use library from point 1 to check if it has data available for every day which was not a market holiday (look for lacking data/inconsistiences). If it finds some dates for which Stooq lacks data and it should contain it, download data for given ticker which lacks this data from Yfinance as a fallback. Check if yfinance contains data for that day, if yes use it to fill the blank in Stooq-based DataFrame. If it also does not, we assume this was some market holiday not detected by our market holiday calendar and ignore the blank. Add calls to logger (DEBUG level) to show info if you detect some gaps in the data. But make it smart enough to detect periods where data for given symbol was not available for some time from both sources - maybe stock was not listed at those times (not yet listed or delisted?)
