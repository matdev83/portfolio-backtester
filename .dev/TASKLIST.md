- [ ] Review all strategies/scenarios. Add checks that will ensure they only execute if they have enough of historical data available to reliably perform all computations. You may need to check how much historical data each strategy needs to calculate properly it's parameters/indicators/measures. Ensure each only runs once it have enough data. Example: strategy is using 10 month moving average and momentum calculated in 13 month window. We should ensure strategy only tries to run if it has at least 13 months of historical data available, as this is the longest required lookback based on it's code/rules.
- [ ] Improve data download process: 1. Import python library used to generate/check market holiday days. 2. Create a new meta-downloader. It should by default use Stooq data. After downloading all available data from Stooq it should use library from point 1 to check if it has data available for every day which was not a market holiday (look for lacking data/inconsistiences). If it finds some dates for which Stooq lacks data and it should contain it, download data for given ticker which lacks this data from Yfinance as a fallback. Check if yfinance contains data for that day, if yes use it to fill the blank in Stooq-based DataFrame. If it also does not, we assume this was some market holiday not detected by our market holiday calendar and ignore the blank. Add calls to logger (DEBUG level) to show info if you detect some gaps in the data. But make it smart enough to detect periods where data for given symbol was not available for some time from both sources - maybe stock was not listed at those times (not yet listed or delisted?)
- [ ] Genetic optimizer seems defunct. Please debug & fix it
- [ ] Bug hunt: Create a list of all available strategies/scenarios and put those on your todo list. Run optimizer on all available strategies, one by one. Analyze each run's output. Look for errors, warnings, signs of missing data, infinity reads plus or minus, 0 reads, NaN reads, extremally optimistic strategy results. Extremally pessimistic strategy results. Tackle encountered problems one by one.
- [ ] Implement the missing filtered_lagged_momentum strategy based on this academic paper: Title	“Momentum at Long Holding Periods”

Implement a variant which will be long-only (without the short leg), use the same universe used by other strategies.
I think this will be similar to the Momentum_Unfiltered strategy, so you may use it's code as reference.
