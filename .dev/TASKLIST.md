# Task 1

1. Current Work: I have been working on resolving a `ValueError` in the `portfolio-backtester` project. The error, "Sizer 'rolling_downside_volatility' requires a 'window' parameter, but it was not found in strategy_params," indicates that a required parameter for the position sizer function is missing during backtest execution.

2. Key Technical Concepts:

   - __Python Backtesting Framework:__ The project is a Python application for portfolio backtesting.
   - __Scenario Configuration (YAML):__ Backtesting scenarios, including strategy and position sizer parameters, are defined in `config/scenarios.yaml`.
   - __Position Sizers:__ Functions like `rolling_downside_volatility_sizer` are used to calculate position weights based on various financial metrics. These functions have specific required parameters (e.g., `window`, `target_volatility`).
   - __Parameter Passing:__ The `Backtester` class's `run_scenario` method is responsible for extracting parameters from `scenario_config['strategy_params']` and passing them to the selected sizer function.
   - __Python Module Loading/Importing:__ A significant part of the problem has revolved around Python's module import mechanism, where initial imports can lead to outdated references to global variables if the source files are modified later.
   - __Debugging with Logs:__ I have extensively used `logging.debug` statements to trace the flow of data and the values of critical variables (`filtered_sizer_params`, `window_param`, `target_return_param`) at different stages of execution.

3. Relevant Files and Code:

   - `src/portfolio_backtester/backtester.py`: This is the main entry point and contains the `run_scenario` method where the sizer functions are called. I have modified this file to:

     - Correctly extract and pass `window` as a positional argument and `target_volatility` as a keyword argument to sizer functions.
     - Add debug logging to trace the `filtered_sizer_params` and extracted parameters.
     - Ensure the configuration is reloaded and re-referenced from `config_loader` before initializing the `Backtester` instance.

   - `src/portfolio_backtester/portfolio/position_sizer.py`: Defines the `rolling_downside_volatility_sizer` function, which requires `window` and `target_volatility`.

   - `config/scenarios.yaml`: This configuration file defines the `Momentum_DVOL_Sizer` scenario. I have modified it to include `sizer_dvol_window: 2` and `target_volatility: 0.10` under its `strategy_params`.

   - `src/portfolio_backtester/config_loader.py`: This module is responsible for loading configurations from YAML files. I have reviewed its structure to understand how configurations are loaded.

4. Problem Solving:

   - __Initial `TypeError`:__ The backtester initially failed because `rolling_downside_volatility_sizer` was missing the `window` argument.
   - __Config Update (Attempt 1):__ I added `sizer_dvol_window` and `target_volatility` to `strategy_params` in `config/scenarios.yaml`.
   - __Parameter Passing Logic Refinement (Attempt 2):__ I adjusted the `run_scenario` method in `backtester.py` to correctly handle positional and keyword arguments for sizer functions, specifically extracting `window` and `target_return` (which `target_volatility` was being mapped to). This led to a `ValueError` because `window_param` was `None`.
   - __Pylance Errors (Side Fix):__ I addressed unrelated Pylance type errors in `_plot_performance_summary` by ensuring scalar values were used for plot limits.
   - __Config Reloading (Attempt 3 & 4):__ I realized the configuration might not be reloading. I added `config_loader.load_config()` and then explicitly re-imported/re-referenced the global config variables in `backtester.py`'s `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
   - __Persistent Issue:__ Despite these changes, debug logs consistently show that `scenario_config['strategy_params']` within the `Backtester` instance still only contains `{'long_only': True}`, indicating that `sizer_dvol_window` and `target_volatility` are not being loaded into the active scenario configuration. This is puzzling, as the `config/scenarios.yaml` file on disk *does* contain these parameters.

5. Pending Tasks and Next Steps: The core problem remains that the `Momentum_DVOL_Sizer` scenario's `strategy_params` are not correctly reflecting the values from `config/scenarios.yaml` at runtime. My next steps are:

   - __Verify File Content:__ "I will try to read the `config/scenarios.yaml` file *again* using `read_file` to confirm its current content on disk. This is to rule out any issues with the `replace_in_file` tool or the file system."
   - __Deep Dive into Config Loading:__ "If the content is indeed correct on disk, the next step would be to add debug logging directly within `config_loader.py` to see what `yaml.safe_load` actually returns for `scenarios_data`." This will help determine if `yaml.safe_load` is the source of the problem.
